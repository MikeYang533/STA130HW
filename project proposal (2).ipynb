    "Analysis 1: Impact of Frequency of Social Interactions on Mental Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research Question: \n",
    "Does the frequency of social interactions have a measurable effect on individuals' reported well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables:\n",
    "Independent Variable: Frequency of social interactions (e.g.,CONNECTION_meaningful_interactions).\n",
    "Dependent Variable: Self-reported mental well-being score (e.g.,WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health ).\n",
    "Rationale: Analyzing these variables can provide valuable insights into whether higher social activity correlates with increased well-being. Bootstrapping allows for estimating the reliability of the association and provides confidence intervals without strict parametric assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visualizations:\n",
    "Scatter Plot: To visualize the relationship between social interaction frequency and well-being.\n",
    "Histograms: To show the distribution of the bootstrapped correlation coefficients.\n",
    "Summary Statistics: Mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals derived from bootstrapped samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analysis:\n",
    "Bootstrapping Method:\n",
    "Randomly resample the data with replacement multiple times (e.g., 1,000 iterations).\n",
    "Calculate the correlation coefficient for each resample.\n",
    "Use the distribution of the bootstrapped correlation coefficients to estimate a 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "Confidence interval: use 95% CI to test if the prediction of parameter is reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hypothesis:\n",
    "Bootstrapping does not require normality in the original data, making it suitable for evaluating the confidence of estimates derived from potentially non-normal data.\n",
    "Hypothesis: Higher frequency of social interactions is positively associated with increased well-being.\n",
    "Expected Outcome: If the bootstrapped confidence interval for the correlation does not include zero, it suggests a significant association.\n",
    "Relevance: The results can reinforce the importance of social engagement for mental health, offering empirical backing for public health campaigns promoting social connections as a tool for improving mental well-being."

    "Analysis 2: Association Between Working Time and Physical Health Status\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research Question\n",
    "Specific Question: How is the number of working hours associated with reported health status?\n",
    "Objective: To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the number of working hours per week and participants' self-reported health status, exploring whether longer working hours correlate with poorer or better perceived health.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables to Explore\n",
    "Independent Variable: Number of working hours per week (e.g.,WORK_hours_per_week).\n",
    "Dependent Variable: Physical health status (e.g., WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health).\n",
    "Additional Control Variables: Age, employment type (full-time/part-time), and occupation could be included to control for confounding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploration Method\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Compute the mean and standard deviation for the number of working hours and health status.\n",
    "Summarize the distribution of health status across different working hour categories (e.g., <20 hours, 20–40 hours, 40–60 hours, >60 hours).\n",
    "Visualizations:\n",
    "Box Plots: To show the distribution of health status within each working hour category.\n",
    "Scatter Plots: To visualize the relationship between working hours (as a continuous variable) and health status.\n",
    "Bar Charts: To display the average health status across different working hour ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analysis Plan\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "Correlation Analysis: To assess the linear relationship between working hours and health status.\n",
    "Confidence Interval: Use 95% CI to test if the inference is reliable\n",
    "assumption: assume a linear relationship between working hours/week and health score.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hypothesis \n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: There is no significant association between the number of working hours and reported health status.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: Higher working hours are associated with a significant change in reported health status.\n",
    "Expected Outcome:\n",
    "It is hypothesized that working longer hours (e.g., >40 per week) will be associated with poorer health status, based on existing literature indicating the potential for work-related stress and burnout to negatively impact health.\n",
    "Relevance:\n",
    "The results of this analysis could contribute to public awareness about work-life balance and its impact on health. If a significant association is found, it could provide evidence for initiatives promoting healthier working conditions."
