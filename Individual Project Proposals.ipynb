    "First Analysis: \n",
    "Self-Identity Influncicies on Mental Health Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "1: research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a conection between self-identity variables (such as LGBTQ+ and Indigenous identity) and mental health scores (including body image and neuroticism)within the CSCS dataset? If so, to what extend do these identity variable relate to the mental health socres?\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Variables I plan to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "a: \"DEMO_identity_lgbtq\"(This refers to individuals who are self-identified as a part of the LGBTQ+ community),\n",
    "b: \"DEMO_identity_indigenous\"(This refers to individuals who are self-identified as a part of the indigenous groups),\n",
    "c: \"PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_fatness_evaluation_score\"(This variable refers to the body size dissatisfaction level. If the score gets higher, it indicate greater dissatisfaction with body size or shape),\n",
    "d: \"PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_negative_affect_score\"(This variable refers to the negative emotion level.\n",
    "If the score gets higher, it indicate a stronger negative emotional associated with one's appearance or body size),\n",
    "e: \"PSYCH_big_five_inventory_neurotic_score\"(This variable refers to the emotional instability level. The higher scores indicating greater emotional instability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing these identity variables like LGBTQ+ and Indigenous status helps to discover if people who are from minority groups has harder mental health challenges directly, which is linked with the course project’s objective of raising awareness about underrepresented populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots/visualizations or summary statistics might be useful?\n",
    "(1): Violin Plot\n",
    "Justification: By using the Violin Plots, I am able to show the distribution of body image scores(fatness_evaluation_score, negative_affect_score) within each identity group(LGBTQ+, Indigenous). This provides me with a sense of both the density and variation within each group.\n",
    "(2): Grouped Bar Charts\n",
    "Justification: By using the bar charts, I am able to compare mean scores of mental health(neurotic_score) factors between identity groups (LGBTQ+ vs. non-LGBTQ+, Indigenous vs. non-Indigenous). Bar charts allow for clear comparison of means, making it easy to spot significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Method I want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my first analysis, I want to use the bootstraping method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to perform the analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Separate the data into groups based on identity factors (LGBTQ+ vs. non-LGBTQ+, Indigenous vs. non-Indigenous). Select the mental health indicators I'm analyzing (body image dissatisfaction and neuroticism scores)\n",
    "(b) For each group, repeatedly sample (with replacement!!!) from the observed scores for body image dissatisfaction and neuroticism. For example, I might draw 1,000 bootstrap samples of the mean or median score for each group.\n",
    "Each sample should be the same size as the original group, and I calculate the mean (or median) of each resampled dataset.\n",
    "(c) After generating all resampled means or medians, create a distribution of these values for each group.\n",
    "Calculate the 95% confidence interval by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution. See where the true mean or median is likely to locate.\n",
    "(d) Compare the confidence intervals for each group’s mean or median. If the intervals for LGBTQ+ vs. non-LGBTQ+ or Indigenous vs. non-Indigenous groups do not overlap significantly, this may indicate a meaningful difference between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions I noted:\n",
    "(a) Each observation within a group is independent, meaning one person’s score doesn’t influence another’s\n",
    "(b) The data might be heavily skewed or the distribution within a group might not be well represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants who self-identified as LGBTQ+ or Indigenous will report higher scores for body image dissatisfaction and neuroticism compared to participants who do not identify with these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hypothesis holds, it means there's a need for targeted mental health resources and support for LGBTQ+ and Indigenous populations. Demonstrating this could help in building programs and resources that address specific mental health needs of these groups, thus fulfilling the goal of raising awareness and interest around the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible results:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The mean or median scores for body image dissatisfaction and neuroticism will be significantly higher for LGBTQ+ and Indigenous participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) If the bootstrapped confidence intervals for the mean or median scores of each mental health indicator in the LGBTQ+ or Indigenous groups do not overlap significantly with the intervals for non-LGBTQ+ or non-Indigenous groups, this would support the hypothesis that these identity factors are associated with higher levels of mental health challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of Possible Results to the Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "These results reveals whether there are meaningful differences in mental health indicators between identity groups. This would highlight potential mental health dicrepancies within the population which is linked with the project’s objective to raise awareness about underrepresented and often overlooked groups."

    "Second Analysis:\n",
    "Gender and Age Association with Self-Reported Mental Health Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "1: research question:\n",
    "How do age and gender correlate with self-reported mental health scores, expecially in traits like neuroticism and dissatisfaction with body image?\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Variables I plan to explore:\n",
    "(a)\"DEMO_age\"(This refers to individual's age),\n",
    "(b)\"DEMO_gender\"(This refers to individual's gender),\n",
    "(c)\"PSYCH_big_five_inventory_neurotic_score\"(This variable refers to the emotional instability level. The higher scores indicating greater emotional instability),\n",
    "(d)\"PSYCH_big_five_inventory_extraverted_score\"(This variable refers to the level of extraversion, higher values on this variable indicates greater level of extraversion),\n",
    "(e)\"PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_height_dissatisfaction_score\"(This variable refers to the height dissatisfaction level. If the score gets higher, it indicate greater dissatisfaction with body height),\n",
    "\n",
    "Why choosing these variables?\n",
    "Age and gender are key variables that can influence self-perception and mental health scores. Including personality traits like neuroticism and body dissatisfaction scores helps to explore whether there is a pattern in these mental health indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots/visualizations or summary statistics might be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Box Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot is used to visualize distributions of neuroticism and body dissatisfaction across gender and age groups. This will highlight any differences in mental health indicators between different age and gender groups, showing spread and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to summarize each variable by gender and age group, providing an easy-to-understand summary of average value and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: These visualizations are straightforward and effectively reveal patterns or associations across different age and gender groups, which help us to identify what age range and gender grounp we should pay more attention to and raise awareness about these targeted populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Method I want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my second analysis, I want to use the Simple Linear Regression method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to perform the analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "(a): Define my independent veriable - age (DEMO_age), gender (DEMO_gender) and my dependent variable - neuroticism score (PSYCH_big_five_inventory_neurotic_score), extraversion score (PSYCH_big_five_inventory_extraverted_score) and height dissatisfaction score(PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_height_dissatisfaction_score) at the very begining.\n",
    "(b): Use Python or Chatbot to run the regression analysis by fititng a linear model that the dependent variable (body image and mental health score) is predicted by the independent variable (age and gender).Then, record the regression coefficient (slope), which indicates how much the mental health score changes with each additional year of age, and the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a): The relationship between age and the mental health score is linear (as age increases, the change in score is consistent).\n",
    "(b): Each participant’s data (age and mental health score) is independent of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age will have a measurable effect on neuroticism and extraversion scores, to be more specific: Firstly, older individuals may show lower neuroticism scores, as prior research often links aging with increased emotional stability. Secondaly, age might be associated with changes in extraversion scores, though the direction of this association could vary (younger people may be more extraverted due to social and developmental factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible results:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a): If the regression slope for age predicting neuroticism is negative and statistically significant, it would mean that as age increases, neuroticism scores tend to decrease. This might indicate that older individuals are generally less neurotic, suggesting increased emotional stability with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)If the regression slope is close to zero and not statistically significant, it would suggest that age does not predict neuroticism in this dataset. This outcome might indicate that neuroticism remains relatively stable across different age groups within this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of Possible Results to the Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "If age is significantly related to neuroticism or extraversion, it could highlight age-related mental health trends, which may be important for awareness and targeted mental health support. Discovering these trends can promote discussions around how personality traits and mental health may evolve with age, thus supporting the project’s goal of raising awareness on demographic influences on mental health."

    "Third Analysis:\n",
    "Provincial Differences in Well-being and Personality Traits\n",
    "\n",
    "1: research question:\n",
    "Are there significant differences in personality traits and self-reported well-being scores across different provinces in Canada?\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Variables I plan to explore:\n",
    "(a): GEO_province (This refers to which province the individual is living in),\n",
    "(b): PSYCH_big_five_inventory_agreeable_score (This score measures an individual’s level of agreeableness the higher the agreeablenes sscore indicates  more easy-going. The lower the score means more unfriendly),\n",
    "(c): PSYCH_big_five_inventory_conscientious_score (This score measures an individual’s level of responsibility the higher the agreeableness score indicates more dependable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why choosing these variables?\n",
    "Studying provincial differences allows us to see if there are location-based influences on mental health or personality traits, which can spark interest in the impact of environmental or cultural factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots/visualizations or summary statistics might be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)Box Plots \n",
    "Justification: To comparing distributions of well-being and personality traits across provinces, box plots are effective for comparing multiple groups and highlighting regional variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Mean\n",
    "Justification: Calculate the average scores for each province, with provinces color-coded by average well-being or personality score. This allows for quick visual interpretation of geographical trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Method I want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my third analysis, I want to use the Bootstrapping method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to perform the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)Separate my data into groups based on provinces and select the personality traits of interest, such as agreeableness score (PSYCH_big_five_inventory_agreeable_score) and Conscientiousness score (PSYCH_big_five_inventory_conscientious_score).\n",
    "(b)For each province, repeatedly resample (with replacement) from the observed scores for agreeableness and conscientiousness. For example, draw 1,000 bootstrap samples of the mean or median score for each province.\n",
    "Each resampled dataset should match the size of the original sample from each province, and calculate the mean (or median) score for each resample.\n",
    "(c)After generating all resampled means or medians for each province, create a distribution of these values and \n",
    "calculate the 95% confidence interval by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of each province’s bootstrap distribution. This interval provides an estimate of where the true mean or median score is likely to fall.\n",
    "(d)Compare the confidence intervals for the mean or median scores across provinces. If the intervals for certain provinces do not overlap significantly, this suggests a meaningful difference in personality trait scores between these provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)Each participant’s personality trait score (agreeableness and conscientiousness) within a province is independent of others. This means that each individual’s score reflects their own experience and is not influenced by other participants.\n",
    "(b)Bootstrapping involves sampling with replacement, meaning that each participant’s data point can be selected multiple times within a resample. This assumes that each observation has an equal chance of representing the population’s variability in the resampled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Average scores for agreeableness and conscientiousness may vary across provinces. To be more specific: Certain provinces might score higher on agreeableness, possibly reflecting regional cultural or social influences.\n",
    "Conscientiousness scores might differ by province due to lifestyle or environmental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible results:\n",
    "(a) If the bootstrapped confidence intervals for mean agreeableness or conscientiousness scores do not overlap significantly between provinces, this suggests real differences in these traits across regions.\n",
    "(b) These differences might indicate that certain personality traits are influenced by regional cultural or environmental factors, which would be meaningful for understanding regional personality patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of Possible Results to the Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "These possible results would provide insights into the research question by revealing whether there are significant regional patterns in personality traits. This could highlight how personality might be shaped by the environment, cultural factors, or other regional influences, aligning with the project’s goal to raise awareness around demographic factors in personality and mental health."
